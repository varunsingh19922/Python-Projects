The details of this project are listed in the document "TicTacMinimaxAB". This assignment contains code and test programs written and provided by Dr. Frank Coyle, Associate Professor at SMU's Lyle School of Engineering. 
This project aims to implement a smart bot for the multiplayer game Tic Tac Toe. The bot will hope to make each move so that takes it closer to Victory.

1. I wrote the code for functions
   a. get_child_boards(board, char)
   b. evaluate(board)
   c. is_terminal_node(board) of the RunMiniMax and RunMiniMaxAB classes.
